			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</header>
		<p><h3>I am a Web Developer specializing in frontend languages. I like to help companies create and expand their online presence.</h3>

			<h4>Web Development Languages: React.js | Node.js | JavaScript | CSS | HTML5 | Python | SQL </h4>
			
			<h4>I have a dream of starting two businesses, one that will change my life and one that would change the lives of others. Chasing this dream has come in the form of door-to-door sales, managing teams of sales reps, managing offices for self storage facilities, and countless hours researching companies and industries, and doing due diligence to bring start-up business models to those that would listen. Most recently, chasing the dream has come in the form of learning full stack web development, web3, and blockchain. I am excited to work for companies that can help develop and broaden my skill set that will one day help me achieve my goals of helping others. </h4>
			
			<h4>Not only am I a web developer but I am a web developer with kickass communication skills! My sales career prepared me to build relationships and communicate effectively with those around me. I enjoy talking about business, sports, life, and understanding how the code I'm working on affects the entirety of the business. A company's success is my success.</h4>
			
			<h3>If you are interested in hearing more of my story or if you know someone I should connect with, please send me a message. I love getting to know new people and learning more about their journey.</h3></p>
